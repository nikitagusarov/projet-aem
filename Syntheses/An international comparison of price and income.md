# AN INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF PRICE AND INCOME ELASTICITIES FOR WINE CONSUMPTION
Authors : Walter C. Labys
Year : 1976

## Introduction
Price elasticities hâve been estimated which can be used to predict wine industry sales and profits as well as to assess the impact of wine taxes on total tax revenues.  
Income elasticities hâve been estimated which can predict industry growth based on changes in the standard of living. 

## Research objecttive
In the study, price and income elasticities computed for several nations are compared to those found for Australia by Miller and Roberts (1972) and Taplin and Ryan (1969).

## The problems assoeiated with the calculation of wine and liquor elasticities, as cited by Simon (1966):
1.	Changes in taste in wine consumption occur frequently.
2.	Changes in relative prices, relative income, price levels and other variables cause elasticities to vary over time.
3.	Wine price sériés of reasonable quality and quantity are difîicult to obtain.
4.	Changes in wine prices hâve been infrequent, although this has been less true since the period beginning 1965 (view Bordeau price analysis).

## Model
The author uses the following model specification :  
$$log C_t ~ E - E_1 log P_t + E_2 log PB_t + E_3 log h + U_t$$
Where :
* wine consumption C_t
* national income I_t  
are in per capita form
* the wine price variable P_t 
* the beer price variable PB_t  
as well as It are appropriately deflated.  
The beer price variable has been included to represent the substitution effect appropriate to models of this type. 
Accordingly, E1 is the price elasticity of demand, E2 is the cross-price elasticity between wine consumption and beer prices, and Es is the income elasticity of demand. 

## Limitations
1. A consumption relation incorporating the compétitive efïects of beer could be suitably estimated only for France
2. expérimentation with beer consumption variables did not yield meaningful results for other countries
3. Shortcomings encountered resuit from the fact that the consumption variables represent aggregate wine quantities rather than quantities of a particular wine grade or type
4. The price variables are in the form of an index, whose composition represents a substantial but not total portion of the wine type identified in the quantity data

## Findings 
1. The régression results indicate an inelastic response to price in most countries, the exceptions being Italy and the imported price équation of the U.S. 
The elasticity of —0 062 estimated for France can be compared to that of —0-06 found by Fouquet (1973). 
2. Values of income elasticities found for most countries are below 0-28, the exceptions being 0-92 for F. R. Germany and 2-34 and 3-34 for the U. S. 
3. *Hypothesis of Taplin and Ryan (1969) that a generally inverse re- lationship exists between income elasticities and consumption levels for wines, as it does for other foods and beverages.*
