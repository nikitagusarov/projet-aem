## Research objectives
This paper tried to ascertain the existence of a possible degree of heterogeneity within nonpremium wines and to measure, by means of elasticity computation, the relationships among categories of wines aggregated with criteria that go beyond price. 
A demand system (censored QUAIDS) was estimated, using a statistically representative panel of 6,773 Italian households, to see to what extent, if any, substitution occurs in home consumption of basic wines, which is the main channel of distribution of inexpensive wines in Italy.

## Results
The market for cheaper wines is complex, and products, categorised as proposed, show a significant degree of heterogeneity.  
The most salient elements are low elasticities for carton wine of the market leader (ML) and high elasticity of nonbrand wine in cartons (OC).
Albeit with the necessary caution, on the basis of the results, it may be stated that also in the segment of more economical wines, brand is an effective instrument of diversification.

## Suppositions
1. In the past three decades or so, the world wine market has experienced dramatic upheavals. 
One of the major changes has involved the structure of wine demand (Labys and Cohen 2006; Anderson and Nelgen 2011). 
In the larger traditional producing and consuming countries, Italy and France, the annual per capita consumption of wine was, until the 1970s, higher than 100 litres (Corsi et al. 2004), while, in the last three decades, it has declined to between 50 and 40 litres (OIV 2012).
2. In the wine trade, it is common to distinguish wines into two broad classes according to price category: nonpremium, less expensive wines with basic quality characteristics; and premium, more expensive wines with complex quality characteristics and a high-value image (Anderson and Nelgen 2011). 
In the light of the absolute increase and relative importance of more expensive wines, a more detailed classification has been made in the wine business, dividing premium wines into subcategories (Ernst and Young Entrepreneurs 1999; Rabobank 2003).
3. Nonpremium wines1 represent a sizeable part in the world wine market.
Together with the search for increasing value for products, this is one of the main reasons why suppliers are still hugely interested in the market for nonpremium wines (Ritchie 2009).
4. Despite the importance of nonpremium wines, very few studies have specifically investigated this segment (Torrisi et al. 2006). 
One possible reason explaining this lack of coverage could be the presumption that, in a wine category with a narrow price range, there is almost perfect homogeneity due to wines with simple intrinsic attributes, little quality complexity and hence not much differentiation.
5. Studies of nonexpensive wines have to be country-specific for two reasons:
    * markets for nonpremium wines have average selling prices that differ because of different import tariffs and consumer taxes (Anderson and Nelgen 2011); 
    * consumer product perception varies on a country by country basis (Makela et al. 2006).
6. The literature contains no indication on
nonpremium wine categorisation. 
Our study attempts to identify criteria for aggregating nonpremium wines which allow homogeneous categories to be obtained. 
The empirical approach used was to proceed according to the same principles with which the supply of more economical wines is structured on the shelves of large retailers, which is the main site of purchase of packaged economical wines.
7. The key informants all agreed that the critical factors behind the diversification of the supply of nonpremium wines on the shelves are as follows: 
    * packaging; 
    * branding; 
    * price.

## Data
The data used in this study were provided by the AC-Nielsen
home scan, a statistically representative panel of Italian households. 
Households involved in the Nielsen panel regularly record their purchases through a scanner (Consumer Scan, The Nielsen Company, Milan, Italy).  
The information collected concerns value (euro), volume (litres) and the main extrinsic attributes of WAH purchases made by 6,773 Italian households.

## Model
A Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) was
implemented (Banks et al. 1997). 
The use of a model allowing a more general Engel curve shape than the popular Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) of Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) was required.  
Banks et al. (1997) show that the demand for some goods, particularly alcohol and clothing, has a quadratic relationship with the logarithm of total expenditure at higher income levels.
