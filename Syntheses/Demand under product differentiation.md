## Research objective
This paper focuses on the demand side of the oversupply problem in the Australian wine industry and argues that the disequilibria may be reduced by gaining a better understanding of the demand for Australian wine.

## Results
Tha authors prpose their estimates of the weighted averages of own price elasticities by wine attridute.

## Suppositions
1. Industry analysts use the stock : sales ratio to gauge the size and nature of supply–demand imbalances in the market.
2. Wine is a highly differentiated product. 
Arguably, there exist no two wines in any one market that are identical. 
Therefore, it is probable that when the problem of aggregate oversupply is broken down to a more disaggregated attribute-specific level, the complexity of the problem will become evident.
3. The problem of oversupply in the Australian wine industry is especially complex due to the interrelation with the upstream market for grapes. 
As the grape market responds very slowly to changes in the derived demand for wine, sometimes the price behaviour and production decisions in both markets appear to follow different paths.
4. Grape production contracts were offered by wine companies not only to current growers, but also to prospective growers if they produced grapes of a particular type. 
Given that the majority of such contracts had terms of five years, and new plantings take approximately three years to produce a commercial crop, wine companies were attempting to effectively predict demand eight years into the future. 
These contracts also acted as signals to otherwise unrelated growers who used them as indicators of future prices.
5. During the past 20 years, export sales have become increasingly important to the Australian wine industry. 
In 2005 Australian export sales were over five times the level they were in 1986, while domestic sales remained virtually unchanged during the same period.

## Background and previous studies
1. The vast majority of the empirical analyses of wine markets have estimated hedonic pricing equations (see for example, Oczkowski 1994; Combris et al. 1997; Schamel 2000; Oczkowski 2001; Schamel and Anderson 2003; Steiner 2004; Noev 2005). 
Pros : less stringent data requirements and the method’s focus on product attributes, which allows for some degree of differentiation among wine brands.
2. Simple demand systems based on homogeneous product models such as the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) have also been estimated. 
Examples of some applications to wine are Moosa and Baxter (2002), Eakins and Gallagher (2003) and Seale et al. (2003) which attempt to explain the disproportionate growth of imported red wine sales in the US market relative to the domestically produced product.
3. Other demand models used to study wine have predominantly included simple linear demand equation estimations, nearly all of which have been conducted at an ‘overall product’ level, for example, Owen (1979).
4. The AIDS and the other demand models previously reported in
the literature have many shortcomings that make them unsuitable to address wine market disequilibria. 
    * Their ‘aggregate’ product-level nature and restrictive market structure assumptions mean that they cannot adequately capture the varying levels of disequilibria that exist in the market. 
    * As they do not take into account the different attributes of wine, they appear inadequate to analyse a market that is by nature inherently differentiated.
James and Alston (2002) made this point by noting that the majority of economic policy analysis was conducted using models of homogenous products, and that policy effects estimated using such models were probably significantly different from those derived from product differentiation models.

## Model
*We ommit the model as it is not appropriate for our case study*

## Data
We use scanner data sourced from ACNielsen that comprise US wine sales occurring in grocery and drug stores for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. 
The grocery store sector represents 44 per cent of the total US market sales, while the drug store sector makes up 8 per cent.  
We model the choice among the top 50 brands by value in the US grocery and drug store sectors, while the market is defined as the total US wine market and the outside good is defined as the proportion of grocery and drug store wine sales not captured by the top 50 brand wines.  
The data are at the wine-brand level. 
That is, each specific branded wine represents a separate observation (not including wines that have repeated sales across the three years in the sample).
